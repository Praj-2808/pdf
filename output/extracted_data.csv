Solo,"MARIO BELLINI
 I","In its reissue, Camaleonda preserves the elements that have made it a con-
temporary classic. By mutual agreement, Mario Bellini and B&B Italia have de-
cided to keep the cm 90x90 seat module, together with the backrest and the 
armrest, faithful to the original project, whose original cutting pattern was used 
for the new edition. The generous polyurethane padding that forms the charac-
teristic capitonn design remains unchanged, still manufactured with the inno-
vative system of cables, hooks and rings created by Bellini in 1970, which defi-
nes the characteristic look and modularity. Thanks to the tie-rods and the rings, 
in fact, the modules can be unhooked and recombined at will, allowing the sofa 
to adapt to an evolving taste and the dynamic needs of those using it. The fun-
damental characteristic of Camaleonda is its unlimited modularity, a geome-
tric pattern that allows each element to become a sort of enormous pixel throu-
gh which to define your home environment. By hooking and unhooking seats, 
backrests and armrests, you can enjoy the luxury of changing your mind as 
many times as you desire, moving and redesigning the space. A concept 
which is dear to Mario Bellini Of all the objects I have designed, Camaleonda 
is perhaps the best in terms of its sense of freedom. There are infinite number 
of possible configurations. The padding has been thoroughly updated by the 
B&B Italias Research & Development Centre, making it even more comfortable 
than the original version. Thus the magical balance between the rigorous geo-
metry of the square and the welcoming roundness of the padding is confirmed, 
further underlining the elasticity and tactile ergonomics that characterize many 
of Mario Bellinis design projects. Camaleonda can be covered with B&B Italias 
entire textile and leather collection, allowing for another variable in the multitude 
of possible combinations. Camaleonda is a dynamic, alive and sincere object, 
not at all enigmatic, that allows for an infinite number of configurations while still 
maintaining its peculiar and unique identity.

and digital research. It seems a monolith that has been shaped by subtraction, 
rounded and moulded by the designer. 
The irregular shape enhances comfort, the contrasting seams define the design 
and movement. Bend-Sofa combines manual skills and technology, solidity and 
strength, along with considerable flexibility in terms of use ensured by the ex-
tensive range of models.

  T","The beautifully balanced construction of solo14 was obtained 
through the reduction of all superfluous elements and the careful 
proportion of its components. The die-cast aluminum structure su-
pports a deep seat, with a joint back which also acts as armrest, 
on which cushions sit freely. The raw edge faux leather profile hi-
ghlights the silhouette of the arm rest and seat, giving it a unique 
sartorial finish. It is available in four shades natural, dark brown, 
black and taupe, all of which can be paired with different color 
edges, thus creating contrasting or harmonious effects. The die-
-cast process is shown through the specific design of the support 
pieces, available in different finishes.

by the armrest that has a taut cover on the outside, and 
a quilted effect on the inside inspired by the classic 
chesterfield sofa. The point where the two finishes meet 
on the armrest is highlighted by a blanket stitch detail,

  I","If the wings of Grande Papilio protect the head of the 
user, those of Piccola Papilio support the back, creating 
a seat that, despite the small size, precisely responds 
to the demand for comfort. The truncated cone shape is 
unchanged, and there is still a zip on the rear of the 
backrest. It can fit into small rooms or even be arranged 
in a row. It also has a swivel system.

to underscore its ergonomic profile. It is endowed with 
an original spirit that merges with various styles. Three

 T","The Caratos range has grown and is ever expanding - pro-
viding a rich collection of ideas for the most diverse environ-
ments. The common thread of each piece is their recogni-
sable die-cast aluminium base. In addition to the chairs and 
armchairs presented in 2017, Caratos presents a small arm-
chair with armrest, an armchair, a tub armchair, two stools with 
swivel seats, a bench, an ottoman and a coffee table. The 
graphite and amber metal frames are accompanied by blue, 
amaranth, and cream painting, which complement the fabric 
covers. Noteworthy is the introduction of a soft, deep pile wool 
velvet that creates a teddy bear effect. With this new collec-
tion, Caratos proves to be a group of flexible products that will

 A","A sheet of leather pinched in two places at the base here 
is where the movement and natural inclination of the Alys hea-
dboard originate. The Buratti brothers are once again mana-
ging a material that they know well because theyve alrea-
dy used it on the Doyl chair when they explored the theme of 
upholstered leather, made more comfortable than with traditio-
nal processes. For Alys, they designed a comfortable, protec-
tive headboard, a very effective shape that has thin perimeter 
strips marked by a lengthwise seam. The bed frame can be 
placed at two different heights, thanks to a standard equip-
ment made of two sets of feet (h. 5cm or 15cm). The bed sur-
face was designed to be low specifically to suggest an effect 
of suspension and floating of the super-comfortable mattress.
