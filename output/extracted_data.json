        "Description": "In its reissue, Camaleonda preserves the elements that have made it a con-\ntemporary classic. By mutual agreement, Mario Bellini and B&B Italia have de-\ncided to keep the cm 90x90 seat module, together with the backrest and the \narmrest, faithful to the original project, whose original cutting pattern was used \nfor the new edition. The generous polyurethane padding that forms the charac-\nteristic capitonn design remains unchanged, still manufactured with the inno-\nvative system of cables, hooks and rings created by Bellini in 1970, which defi-\nnes the characteristic look and modularity. Thanks to the tie-rods and the rings, \nin fact, the modules can be unhooked and recombined at will, allowing the sofa \nto adapt to an evolving taste and the dynamic needs of those using it. The fun-\ndamental characteristic of Camaleonda is its unlimited modularity, a geome-\ntric pattern that allows each element to become a sort of enormous pixel throu-\ngh which to define your home environment. By hooking and unhooking seats, \nbackrests and armrests, you can enjoy the luxury of changing your mind as \nmany times as you desire, moving and redesigning the space. A concept \nwhich is dear to Mario Bellini Of all the objects I have designed, Camaleonda \nis perhaps the best in terms of its sense of freedom. There are infinite number \nof possible configurations. The padding has been thoroughly updated by the \nB&B Italias Research & Development Centre, making it even more comfortable \nthan the original version. Thus the magical balance between the rigorous geo-\nmetry of the square and the welcoming roundness of the padding is confirmed, \nfurther underlining the elasticity and tactile ergonomics that characterize many \nof Mario Bellinis design projects. Camaleonda can be covered with B&B Italias \nentire textile and leather collection, allowing for another variable in the multitude \nof possible combinations. Camaleonda is a dynamic, alive and sincere object, \nnot at all enigmatic, that allows for an infinite number of configurations while still \nmaintaining its peculiar and unique identity.\nEnia 4Licata 1Feet Natural Beech\n \n \nCamaleonda",
